# odin-recipes

Hello everyone, this is the first project that I'll be doing for the Odin Project curriculum! This project will be a simple recipes website demonstrating my basic knowledge of HTML. With that said, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE RECIPES FOUND IN THIS WEBSITE! THEY ARE ALL FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE IN NO WAY A REFLECTION OF MY OR THE ODIN PROJECT'S IDEAS. Thank you for viewing this repository, have a nice day!
