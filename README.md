# odin-recipes

Hello everyone, this is the first project that I'll be doing for the Odin Project curriculum! This project will be a simple recipes website demonstrating my basic knowledge of HTML. With that said, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE RECIPES FOUND IN THIS WEBSITE! THEY ARE ALL FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE IN NO WAY A REFLECTION OF MY OR THE ODIN PROJECT'S IDEAS. Thank you for viewing this repository, have a nice day!

UPDATE:
Hey everyone! I'm back to add some CSS to make this recipes site a little more interesting! I just got through the very basics of CSS, learning about what it is, selector types, some element properties, and just now, the cascade. I will be implementing what I learned to create a more enjoyable visual experience, so I hope you all like it to some degree. With that said, thank you for viewing this repo!

SECOND UPDATE:
Hey y'all! I'm back to add some more CSS to really make this recipes site pop! I just finished the second bit of the CSS lessons in Foundations, learning about the cascade, DevTools, the box model, and all about block and inline elements. I will be applying what I learned to create a nicer layout for this project, so I hope you all appreciate it. With that said, thank you for stopping by!
